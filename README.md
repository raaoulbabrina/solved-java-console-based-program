Write a Java Console based program with one class that reads your first and last name and counts the number of characters.



The Java main method should call a void method. The name of the void method should be your last name.

Their main method should print your first name and last name and number of characters. Below is the pseudo code for this program

void Main (){

int k = izzat( myfullname );

print (my name is ….)

print (the number of chars in my name is…

}

int izzat(string myfullname){

counter=0;

foreach(char i in myfullname ){

counter++;

return counter;

}
